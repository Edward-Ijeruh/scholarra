# Scholarra

Scholarra is a web platform designed to help Nigerian students discover scholarships, grants, and academic opportunities in one organized place.

Many students miss out on life-changing opportunities because information is scattered across websites, social media, and messaging platforms. Scholarra aims to make access to these opportunities easier, smarter, and more reliable.

This project is being **built in public** as part of my journey to grow as a developer while solving real-world problems.
